# Written Report

[The Github repository must contain a results.md file which describes:]

## Output and Correctness of Each Algorithm

[Summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests were performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.]

## The Answer to the Leading Question

[Address the proposed leading question. How did we answer this question? What did we discover? If the project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what we would do differently as a team.]

Leading question: We're focusing the scope of our project on the MTD bus system on campus. The broad idea of what we want to learn from this dataset is being able to provide more useful information to bus users, including students as well as people who use the MTD bus route but are not on campus residents. This relates to the issue of trying to improve it for passenger utility since that is who this information is intended for.
